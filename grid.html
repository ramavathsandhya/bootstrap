            <p>Bathukamma is a flower-festival celebrated by the women of Telangana and some parts of Andhra Pradesh.[1][2][3] Every year this festival is celebrated as per the Sathavahana calendar for nine days starting on Pitru Amavasya, which usually coincides with the months Septemberâ€“October of the Gregorian calendar. Bathukamma is celebrated for nine days and corresponds to the festivals of Sarada Navratri and Durga Puja. It starts on the day of Mahalaya Amavasya and the 9-day festivities will culminate on "Saddula Bathukamma" or "Pedda Bathukamma." Bathukamma is followed by Boddemma, which is a 7-day festival</p></div>

            <p>Bonalu is a traditional Hindu festival centered on the Goddess Mahakali from Telangana.[1] This festival is celebrated annually in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, as well as in other parts of the state.[2] It is celebrated in the month of Ashada Masam, which is around July and/or August. Special "poojas" (worship/ ceremonies) are performed for Yellamma (one of the many regional forms of Mahakali) on the first and last day of the festival.[3] The festival is also considered a thanksgiving to the Goddess for fulfillment of vows.[4]</p></div>

            <p>Diwali is connected to various religious events, deities and personalities, such as being the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon king Ravana.[14] It is also widely associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and Ganesha, the god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles.[15] Other regional traditions connect the holiday to Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman.</p></div>

          <p>The night before Holi is called Holika Dahan or "Chhoti Holi" whereby people gather around a lit bonfire, symbolising the victory of good over evil and removal of the old and arrival of the new. Various rituals are performed around the fire such as singing and dancing.[25] This ritual is derived from the story of Holika, who attempted to kill Prahlada, the son of Hiranyakashipu, through the flames of a bonfire. Although Holika was endowed with a boon to remain immune to fire, she was burned to ashes, while Prahlada remained unharmed</p></div>
